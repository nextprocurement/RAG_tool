DATE = "Extract precise moments in time, typically denoted by a specific combination of day, month, and year. Retrieve solely fixed dates (such as 'January 1, 2024' or '2024'), excluding relative references (like 'next Friday' or 'two weeks ago')."
DRUG = "Extract pharmaceutical details, encompassing substances with therapeutic or medicinal properties, commonly known as drugs. These substances are designated by specific names, such as 'Aspirin' or 'Lisinopril,' and are typically prescribed in precise dosages, such as '500mg' or '10mg' for therapeutic purposes. Programming languages (e.g., Python) and libraries (e.g., Pytorch, cudatoolkit) are not considered drugs, even if they are used to develop pharmaceutical products."
